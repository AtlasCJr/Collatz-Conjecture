# Animation of Collatz Conjecture in 3D

This Python script generates an animated 3D visualization of the Collatz Conjecture using matplotlib. The Collatz Conjecture is a famous unsolved mathematical problem also known as the "3x+1 problem".

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/AtlasCJr/Collatz-Conjecture
   cd repository

2. Install dependencies:

    pip install matplotlib

## Usage

Run the script to generate the animated GIF:

    Collatz Conjecture.py

## Description

The script initializes a set of points and iteratively applies rotations and scaling based on specific rules related to the Collatz Conjecture:
+ Points are represented in 3D space.
+ Each point is updated and rotated based on its current state and position.
+ The animation evolves over 180 frames, with each frame updated every 50 millisecond
